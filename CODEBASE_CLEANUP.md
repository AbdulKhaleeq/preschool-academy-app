# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Complete codebase cleanup performed to remove unused files, commented code, and unnecessary components before deployment. This ensures a clean, professional codebase ready for production.

## Files Removed

### Root Directory
- `package.json` - Unnecessary root package file (frontend and backend have their own)
- `package-lock.json` - Related lock file

### Backend Files Removed
- `controllers/authController.js` - Completely commented out (69 lines)
- `controllers/authControllerV2.js` - Completely commented out (50+ lines)
- `routes.js` - Empty deprecated file with only comment

### Frontend Files Removed
- `src/App.css` - 859 lines of unused CSS
- `src/logo.svg` - React default logo (not used)
- `src/App.test.js` - Default React test file

- `src/reportWebVitals.js` - Performance monitoring (not used)

- `src/components/MessageComposerModern.js` - Unused messaging component

### Code Modifications
- Removed `reportWebVitals` import and usage from `src/index.js`
- Removed commented heartbeat code from `backend/server.js`

### System Files Cleaned
- All `.DS_Store` files removed from project

## Verification
- Frontend tests pass with no errors
- No broken imports or references found
- All active functionality preserved

## Current State
